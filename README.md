For archival purposes and for serving the ones in need, this repo provides the latest software releases of **[Samourai Wallet](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420204321/https://www.samouraiwallet.com/)** and **[Sentinel Watch](https://sentinel.watch/)** as an APK file.

## Apps

<br>
Latest release of [Samourai Wallet](Samourai%20Wallet/sw-signed-0.99.98i_dexwp.apk), from 2024-03-20. Remember to not use Whirlpool, since this project  is currently non-functional and most likely will throw errors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Unfortunately** I was not able to find the signed messages from TDev, confirming the SHA256 hash value of these APK files. So it's basically ‚Äòtrust me, bro‚Äô. If you have a copy of them somewhere, please drop me a line!

## Dojo

Dojo, the Samourai backend for your node, is still available and maintained by [PavelTheCoder](https://twitter.com/PavelTheCoder). You can get it here from his Github repo:

- https://github.com/Dojo-Open-Source-Project/samourai-dojo

With it, you still can use Samourai Wallet and Sentinel Watch in the future in a private and self-hosted fashion. Just pair the apps with your Dojo as usual and you‚Äôre fine.
