For archival purposes and for serving the ones in need, this repo provides the latest software releases of **[Samourai Wallet](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420204321/https://www.samouraiwallet.com/)** and **[Sentinel Watch](https://sentinel.watch/)** as an .apk file.

## Apps

#### Samourai Wallet

[`sw-signed-0.99.98ii.apk`](Samourai%20Wallet/sw-signed-0.99.98ii.apk)‚ÄÉ[SIG](Samourai%20Wallet/sw-signed-0.99.98ii.asc)
<br>
Released: 2024-03-29
<br>
So far not officially announced by SW, but it contains the latest bug fixes. See this archived page for the [changelog](https://web.archive.org/web/20240416113135/https://docs.samourai.io/en/wallet/releases?ref=blog.samourai.is). **But remember to not use Whirlpool,** since this project is currently non-functional and most likely will throw errors. I did not personally download this file pre-arrest, I took if from [freesamourai.com](https://freesamourai.com/) ‚Äî but I found a [video guide](https://youtu.be/4llMWSHWJes?feature=shared&t=182) of someone using it, uploaded on 2024-04-21, three days prior to the arrest.

The first step into the decentralized Whirlpool coordinator era. Remember to not use Whirlpool, since this project is currently non-functional and most likely will throw errors. I personally downloaded this file pre-arrest.

## Verifying the .apk files
I was able to find the signed messages of TDev on several archive.org pages; this [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240416113135/https://docs.samourai.io/en/wallet/releases?ref=blog.samourai.is) is the best one. They contain the SHA256 hash value of the corresponding .apk file, signed with [TDev‚Äôs key](PGP%20Keys/samouraidev.pgp). This way, you can be sure that it was really build by him. Verify using your favourite PGP tools or simply [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/verify).


## Dojo

Dojo, the Samourai backend for your node, is still available and maintained by [PavelTheCoder](https://twitter.com/PavelTheCoder). You can get it here from his Github repo:

- https://github.com/Dojo-Open-Source-Project/samourai-dojo

With it, you still can use Samourai Wallet and Sentinel Watch in the future in a private and self-hosted fashion. Just pair the apps with your Dojo as usual and you‚Äôre fine.
